## Introduction

Greetings and welcome to my Game Engine Creation semester 1 repository. Here are descriptions of each of the programs involved in the semester's work.


## Program 1 - "Hello World"

This was an introductory program to get us use to c++ coding conventions. "Hello World" programs are typically used for this purpose. Program outputs "Hello world" as a string into the console. This string is not saved nor input by user. Use of "cout" to print text to console.


## Program 2 - "Data Type Size"

A program to show the memory sizes of various data types. This began to introduce variables starting with the types that they can be.

## Program 3 - "Defining Variables"

A program that introduced use of variables. Use of int, float and char initialisation, setting and getting. "cout" used to display value held in variable.

## Program 4 - "Defining User-Defined Variables"

A program that expanded on variable manipulation. Here use of typedef to create a custom int variable and also use of an enum structure. "cout" used to display variable values. 

## Program 5 - "Increment/Decrement Operator"

A program showing use case of increment and decrement operators.  "int" variable is intialised and given a value. This value is then incremented and decremented over the course of the program with "cout" statements to show to the user the current value.

## Program 6 - "Area of a Rectangle"

A program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Two "int" variables are initialised for width, height and area. Width and height are given hard coded values and then are is calculated by doing the height times the width. These variables are then displayed inside a string using a "cout" statement.

## Program 7 - "Converting from Farenheit to Celsius"

A program that converts a temperature in Farenheit to Celsius. Inisialises two "float" variables. Farenheit is given a hard coded value and then celsius is calculated from this. The variables are then intergrated into a "cout" statement.

## Program 8 - "Area of a Circle"

A program calculating the area of a circle. This is also displays use of "const" keyword. A float constant for pi is initialised and hard coded to 3.14159. Two "float" variables for area and radius are initialised. Radius is hard coded and then area is calculated via the formula pi times radius squared. This is then intergrated into a "cout" statement.  

## Program 9 - "Share of Savings"

A program that provides calculation for a share of savings. Two "int" variables are initialised, one for savings and one for user share of savings. A "float" variable is initialised for share percentage. Savings is hard coded to 2000, share percentage to 50 and then share of savings is calculated from these values. A "cout" statement is then used to display the share of savings.

## Program 10 - "Share of Haribo"

This program share out packets of haribo based on number of students, giving each student an equal number of packets. The remaining number are shown as being given back to the user. Four "int" variables are initialised (number of packets, number of students, number of sweets each and number for user) and one "char" variable is initialised to allow user to declare they wish to input custom values. The defualt values for number of packets is 40 and numbre of students 14. There is functionality for custom values (upon starting the program it will ask user to input 'y' or 'n'). A "cout" statement is used to display number of packets for each student and number remaining for user.

## Program 11 - "Doom Difficulty Menu"

A program for a difficulty menu. User is able to choose from a variety of difficulties and then presented with a small description of the difficulty. A "char" variable and a "bool" variable are initilaised. The char is for selection and the bool to confirm user has input a correct selection. "cin" was introduced in this program to take the selection from the user. Upon selection of difficulty a "cout" statement will be used to display the decription fo the difficulty. A switch statement is used to determine which description is to be displayed.
